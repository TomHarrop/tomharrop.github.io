> I am a post-doctoral researcher with a background in bioinformatics, genetics and molecular biology and interests in data science and research relating to agriculture. I mainly work with `R`, `Python` and shell scripts. I have experience in molecular, plant, animal and medical laboratories and installing, maintaining and using computers running Unix, Linux and macOS.

## Personal information

Nationalities
:   Australian and British

Research
:   My research interests include plant and insect research related to agronomy, tools and techniques in bioinformatics and evolutionary and comparative biology.

Technical
:   My main tools are `R`, `Python` and `bash`. I also use `Markdown`, `TeX`, `html` and `css`.  
:   I use `git` and `GitHub` for version control and strive to follow the principles of reproducible research when coding.  
:   I have experience with workload managers for high-performance computing (HPC) including `SGE` and `LSF` and maintain an installation of `SLURM` on my own workstation.  
:   I have built and used workstations and servers that run macOS, Ubuntu and FreeBSD, and run jobs in HPC environments running Debian and CentOS.  
:   I have skills in molecular biology techniques including quantitative real-time PCR, cloning, nucleic acid extraction and cDNA library preparation, as well as classical genetic approaches with live organisms, such as transformation, crosses, microdissection and bioassays.

:   English (native), German (TELC Level B2) and French (TELC Level B1)

About me
:   Outside work I enjoy building and riding bicycles, social football and basketball, cooking, programming and technology.

## Education

2006--2012
:	**Doctor of Philosophy**, Department of Genetics, the University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.  
	Thesis: [*The functions of cytochrome P450s in Drosophila*.](http://cat.lib.unimelb.edu.au/record=b4827945~S32)  
	During my Ph.D. I used classical genetics and modern molecular biology, including transgenic manipulation of gene expression and comparative studies of gene function, to investigate the functions of cytochrome P450 genes in the Drosophila genus.

Awards
:   **2006--2009**, Australian Postgraduate Award

## Experience

### Research positions

2014--Present
:	**Post-doctoral researcher**, UMR DIADE, Institut de Recherche
pour le Développement (IRD), Montpellier, France.  
	I am using machine learning, data mining, statistical analyses and other bioinformatic techniques to study the development of inflorescence architecture in rice, which affects crop yield. We have used laser microdissection and RNA sequencing to characterise molecular events that occur in the developing inflorescence, and we are now applying these results to study the effects of selection on gene expression during the parallel domestications of African and Asian rice.

2013--2014
:	**Post-doctoral researcher**, Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany.  
	At the Max Planck Institute I worked on a bioinformatic and molecular biology project to compare the transcriptional response of different land plants to UV-B exposure, which acts as an environmental signal.

### Professional positions
