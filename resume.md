> I am a post-doctoral researcher with a background in bioinformatics, genetics and molecular biology and an interest in basic and applied research relating to agriculture. I have advanced programming skills in `R`, `Python` and shell scripting. I have experience working in molecular, plant, animal and medical laboratories and installing, maintaining and using computers running Unix, Linux and MacOS.

## Personal information

Date of birth

:	25 December 1982

Nationalities

:	Australian and British

Languagues

:	English (native), German (TELC Level B2) and French (TELC Level B1)

## Education

2006--2012

:	**Doctor of Philosophy**, Department of Genetics, the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.\
	[*Thesis*](http://cat.lib.unimelb.edu.au/record=b4827945~S32): The functions of cytochrome P450s in Drosophila.\
	During my Ph.D. I used classical genetics and modern molecular biology, including transgenic manipulation of gene expression and comparative studies of gene function, to investigate the functions of cytochrome P450 genes in the Drosophila genus. 

2002--2005

:   **Bachelor of Science with Honours (first class)**, the University of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.

## Research positions

2014--Present

:	**Post-doctoral researcher**, UMR DIADE, Institut de Recherche
pour le Développement (IRD), Montpellier, France.\
	In my current project I am working on the development of inflorescence architecture in rice, which is related to grain yield potential. We used a precise laser microdissection and RNA sequencing approach to characterise molecular events that occur during the transitions between meristem types in the developing inflorescence. We are now applying these results to study the effects of selection on gene expression during the parallel domestications of African and Asian rice. Working on this project allowed my to expand my skills in bioinformatic analysis and statistics and my knowledge of plant biology and agronomy.

2013--2014

:	**Post-doctoral researcher**, Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics, Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research, Cologne, Germany.\
	During my stay at the Max Planck Insitute I worked on a short project to compare the transcriptional response of several different land plants to UV-B exposure, which acts as a developmental signal. This position provided my first hands-on experience with plant biology and allowed me to expand my programming and bioinformatic skills.
